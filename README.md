###Data Cleaning: For the data cleaning, I used Power Query Editor. I took followed steps for data transformations
## In dim_players
- renaming the files
* using first row as a header
+ splitting the name into two columns
- removing duplicate records
## In dim_match_summary
- adding a custom column 'stage' to categorize the game into qualifier or Super12
* changing the datatype of stage column to text
## In fact_bowling
- renaming column Bowling Team to team
* creating a ball column from overs column by splitting (like 2.5 over to 2 over and 5 balls)
+ replacing null values to 0
## In batting_summary**
- renaming columns 4s to fours, 6s to sixes, and team innings to team
* renaming column 'out/not_out to out where out=1 and not_out=0
+ changing datatype of 'balls' to whole number
- removing ( text after name from batsman_name


**Power BI: Import data using CSV files, data modelling, transformations using Power Query Editor, created DAX measures, designed dashboard using 
bookmark, tooltip, matrix,scatter chart, area chart, buttons, slicers and many more features.**
